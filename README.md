# Multiclass Semantic Segmentation

## Introduction
Multiclass Semantic Segmentation is a computer vision task that involves classifying and labeling each pixel in an image into specific semantic categories. Unlike object detection, which predicts bounding boxes around objects, semantic segmentation assigns a class label to every pixel, providing a detailed understanding of the image's contents.

## How it Works
In multi-class semantic segmentation, the goal is to classify each pixel into one of several predefined classes. The process typically involves the use of deep learning models, such as U-Net, SegNet, or DeepLab, which are specifically designed for this task.

These models are usually based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and employ encoder-decoder architectures. The encoder extracts features from the input image, while the decoder maps these features back to a pixel-wise segmentation map. This map represents the predicted class for each pixel.

## Applications
Multiclass Semantic Segmentation finds applications in various fields, including:

- `Autonomous Driving:` Enabling vehicles to understand their surroundings and navigate complex environments safely.
- `Medical Imaging:` Identifying and segmenting different anatomical structures and abnormalities in medical scans.
- `Agriculture:` Analyzing crops and farmland to optimize agricultural practices and monitor plant health.
- `Satellite Imagery:` Identifying land use, urban planning, and monitoring environmental changes from satellite images.
- `Robotics:` Assisting robots in understanding and interacting with their environments.

## Challenges
Multiclass Semantic Segmentation presents some challenges, such as dealing with class imbalance, ensuring pixel-level accuracy, and handling diverse and complex scenes. Training deep learning models for segmentation also requires a significant amount of labeled data and computational resources.

## Evaluating Performance
To evaluate the performance of multiclass semantic segmentation models, various metrics are used, including Intersection over Union (IoU), Pixel Accuracy, Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and Dice Coefficient. These metrics help assess how well the model accurately identifies and segments different classes in the images.

# About This Repo
This repository contains the work done for Multiclass Semantic Segmentation of animal body parts using a U-Net model with Efficient-Netb4 as its backbone.

## Project Description
The main objective of this project is to segment the body parts of animals, including their head, body, legs, tail, and background, from images. The semantic segmentation task involves classifying each pixel in the image into one of these specific categories.

## Model Architecture
The U-Net model with Efficient-Netb4 as its backbone is used for this task. The U-Net architecture is well-known for its encoder-decoder structure, which helps in capturing both global and local features for accurate segmentation. The Efficient-Netb4 serves as the backbone to efficiently extract high-level features from the input images.

## Dataset
To train and evaluate the model, a labeled dataset containing images of various animals with annotated body parts is used. The dataset includes multiple classes, including head, body, legs, tail, and background, allowing the model to learn the distinct characteristics of each body part.

for example, given an image like the following one, the model should correctly classify each pixel in the image according to whether it belongs to the animal's head, body, legs, tail, or otherwise, it belongs to the background.
